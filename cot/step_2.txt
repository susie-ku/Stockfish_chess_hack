In this current board state, the last move by White was g4, which is an aggressive move in the opening stage of the game and aims to control the center. However, it also weakens White's king-side quite significantly, especially the f3 and h3 squares.

When choosing the next move, it would be useful to have data about the opponent's past games to predict their preferences and usual tactics. Unfortunately, we don't have this kind of data now. Thus, the best strategy would be to follow the main principles of the early stage game without adapting to a specific opponent.

The main principles for the early stage (opening) game in chess are:

1. Control the center. The player who controls the center can easier move their pieces across the board.

2. Develop minor pieces (knights and bishops). They should be moved to active positions where they can attack as many squares as possible.

3. Secure the king. This is typically done by castling.

4. Don't move the same piece multiple times during the opening. It wastes time (i.e., gives the opponent a chance to make more moves) and can cause weaknesses.

Following these principles, I aim to challenge white's pawn on g4 and prepare for piece development. 

For computing the best move in this scenario, a chess engine, such as the Python `chess` library, could be used. Chess engines work by simulating many possible continuations (step-by-step moves for both sides) using decision trees and then evaluating the resulting board positions to estimate who is likely to win. This could be done, for example, using Python `chess.engine.simple_analysis()`, however no API requests are allowed. Therefore, reasoning based on my expertise in chess, without tools, I opt for pawn to g6.

'g6' attacks the pawn at 'g4' and also paves the way for Fianchetto development of the bishop on 'f8', thus fulfilling several of the opening principles.
